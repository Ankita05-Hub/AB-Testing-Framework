# 🧪 A/B Testing Framework – Streamlit App

This is an interactive A/B Testing Framework built using **Python** and **Streamlit** that allows users to simulate controlled experiments across multiple user groups, visualize conversion rates, and perform statistical significance testing using **t-tests** or **ANOVA**. 

Designed for experimentation, learning, and showcasing how data-driven decisions can be powered through intuitive simulation and statistical analysis.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Simulate user behavior across **A/B or multiple groups**
- 🎯 Set **custom conversion rates** using sliders
- 📊 Visualize group-wise **conversion rates** with Seaborn bar charts
- 🧪 Perform **t-tests** (for 2 groups) or **ANOVA** (for 3+ groups)
- 💾 Save experiment results in `experiment_log.csv`
- 📋 View and download past experiments directly from the app
- ☁️ Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for public access
